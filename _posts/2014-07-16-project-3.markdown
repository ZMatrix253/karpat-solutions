  <div style="text-align: left;">
  Conducted a comprehensive energy audit and utilized ANSYS and MATLAB to model and simulate HVAC system performance, identifying opportunities for optimization to reduce energy consumption, operational costs, and environmental impact.

  <strong>Key contributions included:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Performed an in-depth energy audit of the existing HVAC system, evaluating baseline energy usage, peak load demands, operational inefficiencies, and carbon footprint using data logging and metering tools.</li>
    <li>Developed detailed models of the HVAC system in ANSYS Fluent for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, analyzing airflow patterns, heat transfer, and ventilation efficiency in various scenarios such as summer cooling and winter heating.</li>
    <li>Integrated MATLAB for predictive algorithms and control system simulations, optimizing variable air volume (VAV) systems and temperature setpoints under different operating conditions like occupancy levels and external weather variations.</li>
    <li>Proposed modifications including upgraded insulation, variable speed drives for fans and pumps, and smart thermostats; calculated potential energy savings (estimated 20-30%) and return on investment (ROI) for each using MATLAB scripts and Excel-based financial models.</li>
    <li>Assessed environmental impact reductions, such as lowered CO2 emissions, and ensured compliance with energy standards like ASHRAE guidelines through iterative simulations.</li>
  </ul>  <strong>Outcome:</strong> Identified actionable optimizations leading to projected annual energy savings of up to 25%, with ROIs ranging from 2-5 years, promoting sustainable building operations and providing a scalable framework for future HVAC retrofits.
