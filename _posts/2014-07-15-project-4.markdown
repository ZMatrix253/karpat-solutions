  <div style="text-align: left;">
  Designed a medical mask device to treat Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), a common sleep disorder involving upper airway obstruction, by maintaining airway patency through optimized airflow, comfort, durability, and portability using AutoCAD and ANSYS simulations.<br><br>

  <strong>Key contributions included:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Developed design inputs focused on maintaining airway patency with airflow rates of 4-20 L/min, incorporating adjustable features like nasal pillows and advanced airflow management to prevent apnea episodes.</li>
    <li>Prioritized patient comfort by using soft, hypoallergenic materials such as medical-grade silicone and silastic gel, with mask dimensions tailored to average facial sizes (120-140 mm vertical, 110-150 mm horizontal) and ergonomic elements to reduce pressure points.</li>
    <li>Ensured durability through material selection like Lexan polycarbonate, meeting bending stress requirements of 100-300 MPa, and conducted testing under real-world conditions to validate structural integrity.</li>
    <li>Optimized portability with a lightweight design (50-200 g target, achieved 187 g) and compact features for easy travel and storage, adhering to standards like ASTM F2100 for material performance.</li>
  </ul>  <strong>Outcome:</strong> Created a functional OSA mask device that exceeds airflow requirements (up to 67.2 L/min), fits comfortably on average facial anatomy, withstands daily stresses, and supports patient adherence, potentially advancing treatment options alongside therapies like CPAP, ASV, EPAP, and upper airway stimulation.
