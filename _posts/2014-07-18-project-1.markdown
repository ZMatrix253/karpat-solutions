  <div style="text-align: left;">
  Designed a microfluidic device to replicate osteoporotic bone tissue, enabling research on mechanical and biochemical factors influencing bone regeneration using AutoCAD and ANSYS simulations.<br><br>

  <strong>Key contributions included:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Designed the channel layout and features for the microfluidic device, ensuring precise replication of bone tissue conditions affected by osteoporosis.</li>
    <li>Specified the material selection criteria for the scaffolding component, balancing biocompatibility, mechanical stability, and cost-effectiveness, selecting polycaprolactone (PCL) for the scaffold and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) for channels.</li>
    <li>Analyzed design constraints, address potential risks, and optimize the overall functionality and performance of the microfluidic platform.</li>
    <li>Incorporated surface modifications such as collagen coating and laser ablation for enhanced cell adhesion, along with biocompatibility considerations and sterilization protocols.</li>
  </ul>

  <strong>Outcome:</strong> Created a functional microfluidic platform to simulate osteoporosis-affected bone tissue, enabling further experimentation on proteins and hormones like IGF-1 and GLAST for potential advancements in osteoporosis treatment and bone regeneration research.
