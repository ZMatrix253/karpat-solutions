  <div style="text-align: left;">
  Designed a microfluidic device to replicate osteoporotic bone tissue, enabling research on mechanical and biochemical factors influencing bone regeneration using AutoCAD and ANSYS simulations.<br><br>

  <strong>Key contributions included:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Developed precise channel layouts to accurately replicate bone tissue affected by osteoporosis.</li>
    <li>Specified scaffold materials balancing biocompatibility, mechanical stability, and cost-effectiveness.</li>
    <li>Collaborated with team members to optimize device performance, mitigate risks, and ensure experimental reliability.</li>
  </ul>

  <strong>Technical Specifications:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Channel diameters: 0.43 mm (inlet/outlet), 0.31 mm (within scaffold).</li>
    <li>Device dimensions: 25.69 mm × 11.39 mm × 0.43 mm; scaffold: 12.47 mm × 9.03 mm, detachable.</li>
    <li>Materials: PCL (scaffold) for biocompatibility and mechanical support; PDMS (channels & ports) for flexibility and cost-effectiveness.</li>
    <li>Surface modifications: Collagen coating for biomimicry, laser ablation for surface roughness; sterilized via autoclaving.</li>
  </ul>

  <strong>Outcome:</strong> Produced a functional, biocompatible microfluidic device supporting experimental studies on osteoporotic bone tissue and cellular recovery mechanisms such as IGF-1 and GLAST signaling.
